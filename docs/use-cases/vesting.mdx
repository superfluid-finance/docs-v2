# Superfluid Vesting
Superfluid vesting is simple, non-custodial, liquid and composable. Anyone can create Superfluid vesting schedules easily by using the no-code
Superfluid Dashboard or the Vesting Scheduler SDK built on a robust smart contract framework


## Vesting with the Superfluid Dashboard (No-code)

### Step 1: Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to the [Superfluid Dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance/vesting). Ensure you are connected to the appropriate network (e.g., Polygon Mumbai for testing or Ethereum mainnet for live transactions).

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/assets/dashboard-vesting.png" alt="Vesting Dashboard" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />
</div>
<br/>

:::note
Vesting via the dashboard requires a simple whitelisting. Register your interest to be whitelisted [here](https://airtable.com/appmq3TJDdQUrTQpx/shr6iaRWUXVZwVWSd).

### Step 2: Creating the Vesting Schedule
Fill in the information below in order to create a vesting schedule:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/assets/vesting-schedule.gif" alt="Create Vesting Schedule" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />
</div>
<br/>
1. **Receiver**: Enter the public address, ENS, or Lens of the recipient.
2. **Super Token**: Select the Super Token you wish to vest. If you don't have super tokens, you can wrap your tokens using the [Super Token Wrapper](https://app.superfluid.finance/wrap).
3. **Vesting Start Date**: Set the date and time when the vesting will start.
4. **Total Vested Amount**: Input the total amount of tokens to be vested.
5. **Total Vesting Period**: Specify the duration over which the tokens will vest.
6. **Optional Cliff**: Toggle the 'Add Cliff' option and specify the cliff amount and period if needed.

:::note
The "cliff amount" is the amount of tokens that will be vested at the start of the vesting period. For example, if you set a cliff of 100 tokens, the recipient will receive 100 tokens at the start of the vesting period, and the remaining tokens will be vested over the vesting period.

### Step 3: Preview and Create

After entering the vesting parameters, preview the vesting schedule to ensure everything is correct. Then, create the vesting schedule with a single transaction.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/assets/vesting-preview.png" alt="Vesting Preview" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />
</div>
<br/>

### Step 4: Sharing the Vesting Schedule

A link to the vesting schedule status page can be shared with the recipient, providing them with an up-to-date view of their vesting progress.
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/assets/vesting-ongoing.png" alt="Vesting Custom Page" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />
</div>
<br/>

## Vesting using the Superfluid Vesting Scheduler (for Devs)

The Vesting Scheduler is a sophisticated smart contract designed for setting up token vesting schedules.
It's non-custodial and operates by moving tokens directly from your wallet or Safe to a specified recipient.
The contract includes options for adding cliffs, after which it initiates a linear vesting process through a Superfluid stream,
ensuring the recipient receives tokens directly in their wallet without any need for claiming.

For a more detailed explanation of the Vesting Scheduler, check out the Vesting Scheduler Automation [Full Guide](/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/automations/vesting-scheduler).
