# Quickstart

<MotomoComponent/>

Superfluid is a protocol revolving around a new token standard called Super Token. Super Tokens have special capabilities (super powers?).
One of them allows to create second-by-second token transfers (called Money Streaming).
In this guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up and deploying a basic contract for creating, updating and deleting Superfluid money streams. Let's go!

:::note Why this Quickstart?
This is just an example to get you started with Superfluid. You can use this as a base to build more complex applications.

You DO NOT need to set up the FlowSender contract to create, update and delete streams. You can do this directly from the [Dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance/) or by interacting with the [CFAv1Forwarder contract](https://docs.superfluid.finance/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder).
:::

## Prerequisites

- Solidity knowledge
- A development environment *(Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry)*
- A testnet wallet *(e.g., MetaMask)*
- Access to a testnet native coin *(e.g. Polygon Mumbai Testnet Matic - get faucet [here](https://faucet.matic.network/))*


## Contract Overview: FlowSender

In this guide we will describe the contract `FlowSender`:
- This contract is designed to interact with the Superfluid protocol, specifically to send [Super Tokens](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/overview.mdx) using [Money Streaming](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/overview.mdx).
- This contract enables the creation, modification, and deletion of continuous money streams.
- The contract interacts with an example super token (fake DAI Super Token - fDAIx) to create a stream from itself to a receiver.
- Each time a stream is created, a new receiver is added to the list of receivers, and the Superfluid Protocol keeps track of the balances and the receivers on the blockchain.

:::tip *What is Tx?* 

If you are new to blockchain development, you may not be familiar with the term "Tx". Tx is short for transaction, which is a record of an action on the blockchain. Transactions are used to transfer value, store data, and interact with smart contracts.

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.23;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import { ISuperfluid, ISuperToken } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/interfaces/superfluid/ISuperfluid.sol";
import { SuperTokenV1Library } from "@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts/contracts/apps/SuperTokenV1Library.sol";

interface IFakeDAI is IERC20 {
    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external;
}

contract FlowSender {
    using SuperTokenV1Library for ISuperToken;

    mapping (address => bool) public accountList;
    ISuperToken public daix;

    // fDAIx address on Polygon Mumbai = 0x5D8B4C2554aeB7e86F387B4d6c00Ac33499Ed01f
    constructor(ISuperToken _daix) {
        daix = _daix;
    }

    /// @dev Mints 10,000 fDAI to this contract and wraps it all into fDAIx
    function gainDaiX() external {

        // Get address of fDAI by getting underlying token address from DAIx token
        IFakeDAI fdai = IFakeDAI( daix.getUnderlyingToken() );

        // Mint 10,000 fDAI
        fdai.mint(address(this), 10000e18);

        // Approve fDAIx contract to spend fDAI
        fdai.approve(address(daix), 20000e18);

        // Wrap the fDAI into fDAIx
        daix.upgrade(10000e18);
    }

    /// @dev controls a stream with the given flowrate between this contract and the desired receiver
    function setStream(address receiver, int96 flowRate) external {
        daix.flow(receiver, flowRate);
    }

    /// @dev get flow rate between this contract and the given receiver
    function getFlowRate(address receiver) external view returns (int96 flowRate) {
        return daix.getFlowRate(address(this), receiver);
    }
}
```

</p>
</details>
</div>

- **gainDaiX**: Mints and wraps fDAI into fDAIx (Superfluid's wrapped token).
- **setStream**: Controls a stream between the contract and a receiver
- **getFlowRate**: Reads the current flow rate of a stream.

## Environment Setup and Deployment

Deploy the `FlowSender` contract to a testnet using your preferred development environment.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="remix" label="Remix IDE" default>

### Using Remix IDE

1. **Access Remix IDE**: Visit [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. **Create New File**: In the 'File Explorers' tab, create a new `.sol` file.
3. **Paste Contract Code**: Copy the `FlowSender` contract code into the new file.
4. **Compile the Contract**: Go to the 'Solidity Compiler' tab and click 'Compile'.
5. **Deploy the Contract**: 
    - Switch to the 'Deploy & Run Transactions' tab.
    - Connect to MetaMask, selecting Mumbai Testnet.
    - Click on 'Deploy' to deploy your contract.

For more information, check out the [Remix IDE documentation](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

  <TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

### Using Foundry

1. **Set Up Foundry**: Initialize a new Foundry project with `forge init`.
2. **Place Contract**: Add the `FlowSender` contract to your `src` directory.
3. **Write Deployment Script**: Create a deployment script in the `script` directory.
4. **Compile and Deploy**: Use `forge build` to compile and `forge deploy --network mumbai` to deploy.

Learn more about Foundry at the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh).

  <TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat">

### Using Hardhat

1. **Initialize Hardhat**: Set up a new Hardhat project by running `npx hardhat init` in your terminal.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install necessary dependencies like `@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers`.
3. **Add Contract**: Place the `FlowSender` contract in the `contracts` directory.
4. **Create Deployment Script**: Write a script in the `scripts` folder to deploy the contract.
5. **Deploy**: Run the script using `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai`.

Explore more about Hardhat in the [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info *What is the token address?*
When deploying the contract, you will need to provide the address of the fDAIx token on the testnet you are using.
You can find those addresses in the [Superfluid Explorer](https://explorer.superfluid.finance/goerli/supertokens).
:::

## Interacting with the Contract

Once you have deployed your contract, you can run your tests on your favourite framework. You can also test your smart contract live in the browser using the Superfluid Flow Sender Playground below. Modify `yourAddress` putting the address to your deployed contract and follow the steps on the interface below.

```jsx live
function FlowSenderPlayground() {

const yourAddress="0xe8f9eEDf7f171111169C71119cd625ee629E9831";
return (
    <div>
      <FlowSenderComponent contractAddress={yourAddress} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
