# Bounty Program

The Superfluid Bounty Program allows developers to tackle a variety of technical issues laid out by the Superfluid Team and earn payouts for completion. Ready to get bounty hunting? Let's get started!

## Bounties

Pick a bounty issue you would like to complete in our [repo](https://github.com/orgs/superfluid-finance/projects/17/). They range in skill utilization (Solidity, Node.js, DevOps, etc.) and size.

## Getting Started

Comment on the GitHub issue with the below template:

```
Hi @youssea, I'm interested in taking on this bounty: Expected Completion Date: [ date you intend on completing the bounty by ** ]

```

In the #üí∞bounties channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pPzPEDMVua), notify us of your intent to create the bounty with the below message template:

```
Hi @Sunny | Superfluid#7782, I'm interested in taking on this bounty: Issue: [ link to GitHub issue ] Expected Completion Date: [ date you intend on completing the bounty by ** ]

```

** This is a soft deadline. It is simply so we can check up on progress and offer support.

## During Work

A Superfluid team member will open a Discord thread for communication as you work on your issue. Let us know how things are going and if you've got any questions! We're super responsive :)

## Upon Completion

- Submit a pull request and tag the bounty issue you've completed in it ([Example Pull Request](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/pull/717)).
- Once it's merged, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePPMtMcDndvgJvpkDMtY1BChkrXaqABO0SKA-4c-i2rbhZKA/viewform) and submit [this invoice](https://app.request.finance/create/3834fe3c2faaa829) to us.
    - In the Bounty KYC Form, for "Hackathon Name" put down the "Bounty".
    - In the Bounty KYC Form, for "Your Hack Name" put down the title of your bounty.
    - In the Request Invoice, please invoice for USDC on Polygon (not DAI or any other token).
- Wait for your bounty to pay out on the next Wednesday! Congrats on your valued contribution to Superfluid üèÅ

## Referrals

If you find someone to complete a bounty, you can earn 20% of the bounty value as a referral payout!

- When the person you referred completes the bounty, let us know in the **#üí∞bounties** channel that you referred that person.
- We will verify with the bounty completer that you did in fact refer that person.
- If that looks good, we'll give you the green light to follow steps 2 and 3 of "Upon Completion" below to earn your payout.

:::tip Note
To make it easier for us to verify your referral, please have the person you referred add this to the form field *Your Hack Name*: "Referred by [your Discord or GitHub handle]".
