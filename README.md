# Technical Docs for the Superfluid Protocol

Welcome to the official technical documentation of Superfluid, the protocol layer for real-time finance on the blockchain. Our documentation is designed to provide you with comprehensive guides, tutorials, and reference materials to help you understand and integrate Superfluid into your smart contracts and applications.

## Superfluid Finance Documentation

This web application contains all documentation for Superfluid Finance products. It is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Project Layout

### Superfluid Finance documentation is organized into four main sections:

* **Concepts** - Fundamental Superfluid information or concepts essential for using Superfluid products, such as _Money Streaming_, _Distributions_ and _Super Tokens_.
* **Protocol** - Deep dive into Superfluid smart contracts, and guides to build using Superfluid.
* **SDK** - Guides and tutorials about how to use the Superfluid SDK.
* **Technical Reference** - Technical Reference of the most important Superfluid Contracts.

Superfluid is a protocol that revolves around Super Tokens and their primitives Money Streaming and Distributions. In the Protocol page, each one of these concepts have three items:

* _Overview_
* _Guides_
* _Examples_

## Adding Documentation

### Overview

A product overview should cover aspects such as:

* The high-level components of the product.
* The main functionalities offered by the product.
* The location of the product's source code.
* Where the code artifact resides (e.g., _npm_) and how to integrate with it.

### Guides

Ideally, guides should adhere to the **Principles of a Good Guide**:

* A guide demonstrates a single concept in the Superfluid ecosystem through reusable code.
* Guides consist of an **introduction**, a step-by-step **walkthrough**, and an **output** or end state for verification.
* The goal is for developers to build something within **10-30 minutes per guide** while offering deep-dive references.
